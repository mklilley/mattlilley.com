Absolutely, we can definitely incorporate that part back into the text. Here's a revised version:

Hey there! I'm Matt, a physicist by training, a tech educator by profession, and an explorer at heart. I've spent a good chunk of my life delving into the mysteries of the universe, from working on stability problems in tokamaks during my PhD to investigating alternative fusion concepts at Imperial College London. I've even had the chance to present my research to hundreds at international conferences. But my love for learning and sharing knowledge isn't confined to the realm of academia.

In 2013, I decided to dip my toes into the world of technology. I taught myself how to code and started building some cross-platform web-apps. Now, I code because it's fun and I love tinkering with code to build things that I enjoy using. You can check out a few of my completed projects on my portfolio site, lilley.io.

Education is a big part of my life. I've been involved in it since 2005, teaching everything from advanced mathematical methods to software engineering. I've even run workshops to help business leaders understand new technologies like blockchain and machine learning. These days, I'm focused on helping people figure out if a career in tech is right for them through a weekend-long accelerated learning experience called Taste of Tech.

In 2014, I noticed a shift in the research and education landscape. The rise of open access publishing, crowd funding, citizen science projects, and massive open online courses was pointing the way to a new model of research and education that is open to all. Inspired by this, I've been on a journey to figure out how to make open science and education financially sustainable for me. It's been a fun and interesting ride, involving everything from building web apps and tutoring to building cold fusion experiments and collaborating with researchers at MIT.

But this blog isn't just about sharing what I know. It's about sparking curiosity, encouraging critical thinking, and having a bit of fun along the way. I've got a series on guesstimation that invites you to tackle some mind-boggling problems using nothing but approximation and logic. And if you've ever wondered about the feasibility of growing your own food or the scale of our waste problem, I've got some posts that might pique your interest.

So, whether you're a fellow scientist, a tech enthusiast, or just a curious mind, I invite you to join me on this journey of exploration and discovery. Let's learn, let's question, and let's push the boundaries of what's possible. Welcome to my blog!

I'm always on the lookout for new collaborations, so if you think I might be able to help with something you're currently building or developing, please feel free to get in touch. I genuinely love exploring new things and can't wait to see where my journey takes me next.
