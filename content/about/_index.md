Hey there ðŸ‘‹! 

Welcome to my blog, a place where curiosity reigns and learning never ends. Here, I delve into a wide array of topics around [science]({{< relref "/tags/science" >}}), [technology]({{< relref "/tags/technology" >}}) and [education]({{< relref "/tags/education" >}}). From the mysteries of [quantum physics]({{< relref "/series/solid-state-nuclear-science" >}}) and the challenges of [cold fusion]({{< relref "/series/cold-fusion-lenr" >}}), to [tech education]({{< relref "/posts/taste-of-tech" >}}) and the [potential of GPT]({{< relref "/tags/gpt" >}}). But, this blog isn't just about sharing what I know. I enjoy sparking curiosity, encouraging critical thinking, and having a bit of fun along the way. For example, I've got a [series on guesstimation]({{< relref "/series/guesstimation" >}}) that invites you to solve seemingly impossible problems like "how many people are picking their nose right now?" ðŸ¤”.

Now, you might be wondering, who's the person behind all this? Well, that's me, Matt Lilley. I'm a physicist by training, a tech educator by profession, and an explorer at heart. I spent 9 years in academia [working on fusion energy research]({{< relref "/posts/magnetic-confinement-fusion-instabilities" >}}), presenting at international conferences and lecturing to PhD and masters students on advanced mathematical methods and electromagnetic waves ðŸ¤“.

But, my journey didn't stop at academia. In 2013, inspired by the idea of becoming a self-funded researcher, I entered world of technology. I taught myself how to code and built cross platform web-apps like [Squidler]({{< relref "/posts/squidler" >}}). I've continued to build all kinds of things since then: productivity tools like [Slidee]({{< relref "/posts/slidee" >}}), [Swipee]({{< relref "/posts/swipee" >}}) and [Flashee]({{< relref "/posts/flashee" >}}), [automation bots]({{< relref "/posts/back-in-stock" >}}) and [interactive simulations]({{< relref "/posts/constrained-particles" >}}). I code today because it's fun - there's nothing quite like the thrill of seeing your code creations come to life! You can check out a few of my completed projects on my portfolio site, [lilley.io](https://lilley.io).

Along the way, I discoverd that I don't just enjoy building with tech, I'm also drawn to talking about tech. Since 2017, I've worked in tech education, running accelerated learning experiences to business leaders on all kinds of tech topics, like blockchain, machine learning and quantum computing.

Iâ€™ve also helped people launch their careers in tech (student recommendations onÂ [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-lilley/)) and have launched a weekend-long learning experience called [Taste of Tech]({{< relref "/posts/taste-of-tech" >}}), designed to help people figure out if a career in tech is right for them.

So, whether you're a fellow scientist, a tech enthusiast, or just a curious mind, I invite you to join me on this journey of exploration and discovery. Let's learn, let's build, and let's push the boundaries of what's possible.
