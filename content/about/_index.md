## What do I do?

I [research](https://mattlilley.com/research), [educate](https://mattlilley.com/education) and [code](https://mattlilley.com/code).

## What are my passions?

Physics has always been a big part of my life, whether it’s thinking about basic mechanics problems or trying to tackle the more global challenge of fusion energy.  Whatever the subject, I have always enjoyed exploring new ideas and found great pleasure in explaining things to people.

## What is my story?

In 2014, after spending 9 years working in academic institutions in the UK and overseas, I could see that the research and education landscape was beginning to shift.  The rise of open access publishing, crowd funding, citizen science projects and massive open online courses was pointing the way to a new model of research and education that is not restricted to the few, but open to all.   With the help of technology, anyone could make a difference – you just needed a computer, an internet connection and an inquisitive and open mind.

I wanted to be part of that movement and so, in the years since, I've been on a journey to figure out how to make open science and education financially sustainable for me. I'm not quite there yet, but the journey so far has been pretty fun and interesting. It's involved: building webapps, tutoring, data science, teaching business leaders about technology, building cold fusion experiments, collaborating with researchers at MIT and YouTube. As you can see, I genuinely do like exploring new things.

I'm always on the look out for new collaborations, so if you think I might be able to help with something you're currently building/developing then please feel free to [get in contact](https://mattlilley.com/contact).
