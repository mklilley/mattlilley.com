This year, I've spent a lot of time diving into the world of two state quantum systems as a model to help understand nuclear reactions in sold state, in particular those reported in cold fusion (LENR) experiments.

As we described [last time]({{< relref "/posts/two-state-quantum-systems" >}}), this is not the typical way to view nuclear reactions. It's more common to think about them as a quantum tunnelling problem as originally set out by Gamow [^1].

In order to make the connection between these two ways of viewing nuclear reactions, I'm creating another set of computational tutorials to complement the ones being made over at the [two-state-systems repo](https://github.com/project-ida/two-state-quantum-systems).

This collection of tutorials is dedicated to exploring the quantum behaviour of particles moving under the influence of a confining potential - aka a "quantum box". Such "boxes" can be square e.g. the infinite and finite square wells, or curved e.g. the harmonic potential. We'll explore a variety of different kinds of boxes ðŸ“¦ and how easily particles can escape from them. 

The tutorials are fully interactive [Observable notebooks](https://observablehq.com/@mklilley/quantum-physics-particle-in-a-box?collection=@mklilley/quantum-physics). This means you can play with the simulations live in the browser without needing to install anything ðŸ¥³.

Enjoy.
