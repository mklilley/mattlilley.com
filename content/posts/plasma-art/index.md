The walls of physics departments are often lined with poster contributions from old conferences. The vast majority go without so much as a glance from visitors or fellow researchers. I wanted the walls of the plasma physics group at Imperial College London to be a showcase for research, but in a way that would be inspirational and a bit more accessible. The Plasma Art project was initiated with the aim of displaying large scale images that would simultaneously possess scientific and artistic qualities.

## Frequency chirping plasma waves
Matthew Lilley - 2010

{{< image-link src="plasma-art-chirp.jpg" alt="chirp" >}}

This image shows a spectrogram (frequency against time) from a simulation of a bump-on-tail plasma configuration in the presence of significant dissipation. Surprisingly, the dissipation process (that normally acts to stabilise the system) promotes the formation of long lived plasma waves whose frequency starts at the plasma frequency but then changes rapidly in time, producing what is known as a chirp. Such chirping patterns are regularly observed in Alfv√©n wave instabilities in tokamaks. <a rel="noopener" href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3486535" target="_blank">Physics of Plasmas 17, 092305 (2010)</a></p>

## Conical wire array
Matteo Bocchi - 2012

This image shows a volume rendering of mass density taken from a numerical simulation, using the code GORGON, of a conical wire array with 16 Tungsten wires driven by the Magpie generator. A supersonic, radiatively cooled jet propagates along the axis of the array, displaying turbulent behaviour. Jets from conical arrays have dimensionless parameters close to the ones of protostellar jets, and are used for laboratory astrophysics studies.
