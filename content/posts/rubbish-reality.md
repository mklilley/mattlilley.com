Strap in, folks, because we're about to embark on a whirlwind tour of our wastelands! That's right - in this 6th installment in the [series on guesstimation](/series/guesstimation), we're closing out our food-themed trilogy with a biggie: WASTE!

So, picture a landfill. It's essentially a gaping hole that swallows our waste, an insatiable beast. But exactly how insatiable is it? How gigantic are these holes? Should we lose sleep over this? These are the hot questions sizzling on today's platter!

In our hunt for answers, we'll discover how to extrapolate our personal waste outputs to comprehend the collective impact on a global scale. We'll unravel the concepts of volume and mass, and demystify the notion of density, transitioning our perspective from ordinary rubbish bags to the compact reality of landfill spaces.

Our investigation won't stop at our doorsteps! We're zooming out to take a 100-year glimpse into our possible future. But is it as grim as we often paint it? Well, that's the big question we're aiming to tackle. This quest will bring us face-to-face with the reality of our choices, making us question if our habits and the footprints we're leaving behind are as gargantuan as they seem or is it all a matter of perspective?

Are you ready to challenge preconceived notions, shatter misconceptions and discover the real scope of our impact. Welcome back, explorers!
