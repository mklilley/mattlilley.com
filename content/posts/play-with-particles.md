Inspired by advances in both web and mobile technologies, I created the Play with Particles webapp. The user is able to control the motion of particles through the clicks on a desktop computer or the taps on a mobile touch screen across all devices with a web browser – no installation required.  Play with Particles has been designed to have strong visual and interactive aspects in order to deliver a fun physics experience.  Best of all it is free – try it below or for the full screen experience [go here](https://mklilley.github.io/orbit/).

If you'd like to look at the source code for this app, head over to my [Orbit repo on Github](https://github.com/mklilley/orbit).
