Inspired by advances in both web and mobile technologies, Play with Particles is an experiment in cross platform physics apps. The user is able to control the motion of particles through the clicks on a desktop computer or the taps on a mobile touch screen across all devices with a web browser – no installation required.  Play with Particles has been designed to have strong visual and interactive aspects in order to deliver a fun physics experience.  Best of all it is free – try it below or for the full screen experience [go here](https://mklilley.github.io/orbit/).
