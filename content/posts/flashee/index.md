There's no such thing as an original idea, and this is especially true of flashcard apps. There are MANY apps out there and yet all of them suck (in my humble opinion ü§£)

I wanted a flashcard app that:
- worked off-line by default
- didn't require me to sign-up for an account
- didn't have any bells and whistles, I wanted it to be dead simple

Maybe this kind of app did exist somewhere in the dark corners of the web ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, but I didn't really want to go lurking... and I also like building things... and so:

I built a basic version of [Flashee](https://flashee.lilley.io/) in the Christmas holidays of 2018. The idea was to help me remember physics facts. Since then, I've enjoyed using it every day as part of my casual physics morning routine ü§ì . I thought other people might also find it useful so I decided to clean it up and make it available to everyone for free.
