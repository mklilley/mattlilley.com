I saw the most spectacular rainbow earlier this year.

I should have been fully present in that moment (still working on that). However, I suddenly realised that, although have a physics PhD, I never really spent much time studying rainbows. I somehow managed to opt out of undergraduate optics classes which seems madness in hindsight. In my defense, I was doing a Maths & Physics course so something had to give ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

After the usual "pot of gold" ‚ö±Ô∏è jokes had been told and the spectacle faded into the clouds, I pondered on whether I could recreate this rainbow... inside my computer. In other words, could I simulate a rainbow?

The physics at play is well known - [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction), [dispersion](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics)>), [total internal reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection) - and we learnt about them all at school; so it should be simple right? I've made enough apps and simulations in my time to know it's never simple...ever!

And so, this lovely rainbow idea was consigned to the "Someday" page of my notes... that is, until I was emboldened by my recent success using GPT4 to help me create a [particle simulation]({{< relref "/posts/constrained-particles" >}}). After that, I was convinced that the rainbow idea was not only doable, but would be super fun.

2.5 weeks later, GPT and I finished making the first iteration of the interactive [Let's make rainbows app](https://mattlilley.com/lets-make-rainbows/). It allows you to explore the underlying
physics of rainbow formation by shooting light rays at various shaped prisms
and watching how the different colours bend. You can even make your
own shapes and even challenge yourself to traverse a prism maze.

I think the app is cool, but of course it's not really simulating a rainbow. It turns out, as I thought, the practical details are kind of complicated. So, as a first step, I decided to create something "simple". Of course, it's still not simple and I had to make lots of approximations to make the app work in a nice way but my hope is that, through experimentation, people will develop a intuition for how light behaves and gain a deeper appreciation for the beauty of rainbows üåà.
