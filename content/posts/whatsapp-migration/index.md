After reading the recent news on [WhatsApp and Facebook to share users' data outside Europe and UK](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55573149), I decided it was time to move away from WhatsApp.

The problem is, I've got lots of group chats with plenty of interesting links that have been shared over the years and I don't want to lose them. WhatsApp doesn't give you an easy way to export these links so I created a little tool to help with that.

You are very welcome to use this tool - you can find it at the [whatsapp-extract-links](https://github.com/mklilley/whatsapp-extract-links) repository on Github.

See you on [Signal](https://signal.org/) üòÅ
