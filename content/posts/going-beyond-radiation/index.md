Today I made my debut on the nucleonics Substack ðŸ˜Ž.

I wrote about the tantalising possibility that nucleonics might give us the tools we need to transform nuclear reactions into ones that are free of radiation. It's a provocative idea, but it might just be possible.

Rather than repost all the content here, I'll link out to the post below so you can read it in context with the other posts.
